# Bayesian Statistics with M&Ms

In this unit, we will introduce the fundamental concepts of 
conditional and joint probabilities as well as Bayesian statistics. 

We will use M&Ms for this purpose, because everything is better with 
chocolate.

All materials related to the tutorial can be found online at the 
[tutorial website][bayes]. 

There is also a [form][mmcounts] for collecting the M&M counts. 
When you count your M&Ms, please add your data to that form!
